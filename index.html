            <h3>Trivia</h3>

            <p>I have a black cat. I am from Nebraska. I moved to Dallas in 2010. </p>

            <h3>What am I doing?</h3>
            <p>I am taking classes trying to discover what I want for a career</p>
    
            <h3>Why am I in school?</h3>
            <p>It is difficult to know what one wants to do for a career. I am trying to learn my strengths. These
                introductory classes can help.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-light-grey w3-leftbar w3-border-grey">
            <h3>Career Choice Considerations</h3>
            <p>One can choose to work with the public or working alone. Are you detail oriented or more free flowing in
                your work style? There are so many options like websites, games/animation, security, or databases. </p>



            <h3>Career Choices</h3>
            <p>Will I want to be a web designer? Maybe I should learn Games design? I did find statisfaction with
                creating
                characters but I need to continue exploring all the options.
            </p>
            <p>I like to work on computers but this website design is completely new to me. I have never used any of
                these
                tools. The shortest assignment is taking me days and I am also working. But I should keep trying to do
                it long enough to see if it could be for me.
            </p>
            <h3>Now that I have taken the class....</h3>
            <p>Will I want to be a web designer? I don't think so. Definately I felt this class was beyond what I had any knowledge for until we started WordPress. It certainly did not feel like an "introductory" class. However, these are good foundation skills to have learned.
                I learned to use coding language and functions with Visual Studio. I leanred about file transfers with FileZilla, and about repository work wih GitHub. Using Wordpress has been the easiest of all, and made the most sense to me.
