    <h3>Career Choices</h3>
        <p>Will I want to be a web designer? Maybe I should learn Games design? I did find statisfaction with creating characters but I need to continue exploring all the options.
            </p>
        <p>I like to work on computers but this website design is completely new to me. I have never used any of these tools. The shortest assignment is taking me days and I am also working. But I should keep trying to do it long enough to see if it could be for me.
